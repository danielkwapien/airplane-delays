# Introduction 

On any given day, more than 90,000 flights operate in the US. About one-third of these flights are commercial flights, operated by companies like United, American Airlines, etc. Among these commercial flights, 20% suffer from delays due to various reasons. A certain number of delays are unavoidable, due to unexpected events, but some delays could hopefully be avoided if the factors causing delays are better understood and addressed.

In this case study, we will use a dataset with 9,381 flights that occurred in June-August, 2014 between the three busiest US airports:

  - Atlanta (ATL)
  - Los Angeles (LAX)
  - Chicago (ORD)
  
### The dataset  
  
The dataset AirlineDelay.csv includes the following 23 variables:

- Flight = the origin-destination pair (LAX-ORD, ATL-LAX, etc.)
- Carrier = the carrier operating the flight (American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, etc.)
- Month = the month of the flight (June, July, or August)
- DayOfWeek = the day of the week of the flight (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- NumPrevFlights = the number of previous flights taken by this aircraft in the same day
- PrevFlightGap = the amount of time between when this flight's aircraft is scheduled to arrive at the airport and when it's scheduled to depart for this flight
- HistoricallyLate = the proportion of time this flight has been late historically
- InsufficientHistory = whether or not we have enough data to determine the historical record of the flight (equal to 1 if we don't have at least 3 records, equal to 0 if we do)
- OriginInVolume = the amount of incoming traffic volume at the origin airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- OriginOutVolume = the amount of outgoing traffic volume at the origin airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- DestInVolume = the amount of incoming traffic volume at the destination airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- DestOutVolume = the amount of outgoing traffic volume at the destination airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- OriginPrecip = the amount of rain at the origin over the course of the day, in tenths of millimeters
- OriginAvgWind = average daily wind speed at the origin, in miles per hour
- OriginWindGust = fastest wind speed during the day at the origin, in miles per hour
- OriginFog = whether or not there was fog at some point during the day at the origin (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- OriginThunder = whether or not there was thunder at some point during the day at the origin (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- DestPrecip = the amount of rain at the destination over the course of the day, in tenths of millimeters
- DestAvgWind = average daily wind speed at the destination, in miles per hour
- DestWindGust = fastest wind speed during the day at the destination, in miles per hour
- DestFog = whether or not there was fog at some point during the day at the destination (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- DestThunder = whether or not there was thunder at some point during the day at the destination (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- TotalDelay = the amount of time the aircraft was delayed, in minutes (this is our dependent variable)

### The goal

Predict the response TotalDelay as a function of the other variables

### Descriptive Analysis

It is always a good idea to separate from the beginning the training set (what the tool is going to see) from the testing set (used only to validate predictions)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(MASS)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
library(MetBrewer)
colors = met.brewer('Cassatt2')

# Loading and preparing data
data <- read.csv("AirlineDelay.csv")

# split between training and testing sets
spl = createDataPartition(data$TotalDelay, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)  # 80% for training

train = data[spl,]
test = data[-spl,]

str(train)

summary(train)
```

### Visualization

Add here interesting plots to get information, taking into account the most important variable

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(TotalDelay)) + geom_density(fill=colors[6]) + 
  xlab("TotalDelay") + ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")
```

Most of the flights have a delay less than 1 min (Q1=0, Q2=1, Q3=18)

Highly assymetric distribution


```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(fill=colors[6]) + xlab("log(TotalDelay+10)") + ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")
```

Seems roughly two groups: one with delays less than 7 min (approx) and the other greater (approx)

Or a second group with center (mode) at 10 min

Moreover, half of the observations have a zero delay

Should we omit those observations? If we wanted to do so:

```{r}
# AirlinesTrain = filter(AirlinesTrain, TotalDelay>0)
# AirlinesTest = filter(AirlinesTest, TotalDelay>0)
```

We can still exploring the data

Delays grouped by flight 

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(aes(group=Flight, colour=Flight, fill=Flight), alpha=0.1) + 
  ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(colors[2:8])) + scale_color_manual(values = c(colors[2:8]))
```

Delays grouped by Carrier

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(aes(group=Carrier, colour=Carrier, fill=Carrier), alpha=0.1) + 
  ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(colors[2:9])) + scale_color_manual(values = c(colors[2:9]))
# SkyWest Airlines seems to have more delays
```

Total delays vs Number of previous flights

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(x=as.factor(NumPrevFlights), y=log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_boxplot(fill=colors[6]) +
  ggtitle("TotalDelay vs NumPrevFlights") + theme_minimal()
# number of previous flights seems to increase delay, in a monotic but non-linear way
```

```{r, fig.height=6}
featurePlot(x = train[, c(9:22)],
            y = log(AirlinesTrain$TotalDelay+10),
            plot = "scatter",
            layout = c(4, 4))

```

# Regression

```{r}
ggcorr(train[5:23],  label = T, label_size = 3)
```

It seems that there is no colinearity between any variables

We will make a simple regression model with x = HistoricallyLate and y = TotalDelay

```{r}
lFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay + 10) ~ HistoricallyLate, data = train)
summary(lFit)
```

```{r}
pred <- exp(predict(lFit, newdata = test))-10
cor(test$TotalDelay, pred)^2
```

With such a small $$R^2$$ the linear model doesn't predict anything.

# Multiple regression

```{r}
lFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ ., data = train)
summary(lFit)
```

```{r}
pred.log <- predict(lFit, newdata = test)
cor(log(test$TotalDelay+10), pred.log)^2
```

Well, it is a lot better than the simple linear regression model

# Classification

Let’s now divide the Total Delay variable in just three categories:

* No Delay
* Minor Delay
* Major Delay

```{r}
data$DelayClass = factor(ifelse(data$TotalDelay == 0, "No Delay", ifelse(data$TotalDelay >= 30, "Major Delay", "Minor Delay")))
levels(data$DelayClass)
```


```{r}
data$TotalDelay = NULL
```

## Descriptive analysis

```{r}
spl = createDataPartition(data$DelayClass, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)  # 80% for training

train = data[spl,]
test = data[-spl,]

table(train$DelayClass)
```

```{r}
table(train$DelayClass, train$Flight)
```

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(x=DelayClass,fill = Flight)) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(colors[7:2])) + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(x=Flight,fill = DelayClass)) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(colors[7:2])) + theme_minimal()

```

# Bayes Classifiers

## LDA

```{r}
lda.model <- lda(DelayClass ~ ., data=train, prior = c(1/6, 1/3, 1/2))

lda.model
```

Note there are two linear classifiers because we have 3 groups

Note prior = c(1/6, 1/3, 1/2) are roughly the class proportions for the training set, hence it’s equivalent to

```{r}
lda.model <- lda(DelayClass ~ ., data=train)
```

In practice, a bit better performance is attained if we shrink the prior probabilities towards 1/3

Output: posterior probabilities

```{r}
prob = predict(lda.model, newdata=test)$posterior
head(prob)
```

To predict the labels for delay, we apply the Bayes rule of maximum probability

```{r}
pred <- max.col(prob)
head(pred)
```
which is equivalent to
```{r}
pred = predict(lda.model, newdata=test)$class
head(pred)
```

## Performance

The confusion matrix: predictions in rows, true values in columns (but we can change the order)

```{r}
confusionMatrix(prediction, test$DelayClass)$table
confusionMatrix(prediction, test$DelayClass)$overall[1]
```

## QDA

```{r}
qda.model <- qda(DelayClass ~ ., data=train, prior = c(1/6, 1/3, 1/2))
qda.model
```

Performance:

```{r}
pred = predict(qda.model, newdata=test)$class
confusionMatrix(pred, test$DelayClass)$table
confusionMatrix(pred, test$DelayClass)$overall[1]
```

## A benchmark model

What is the accuracy on a benchmark model that predicts the most 
frequent outcome (No Delay) for all observations?

```{r}
table(train$DelayClass)
obs <- max(table(test$DelayClass))
# Accuracy:
obs/nrow(test)
```

Note the benchmark is not so bad... Too much noise...

We can reduce the noise, or increase the accuracy by considering just two classes: delay or no delay

But the information (or precision) of the output will be weaker or less practical...


```{r}
data$DelayClass = factor(ifelse(data$DelayClass == "No Delay", "No Delay", "Delay"))
levels(data$DelayClass)

train = data[spl,]
test = data[-spl,]

table(train$DelayClass)
```

Very well-balanced classes

```{r}
lda.model <- lda(DelayClass ~ ., data=train)
pred = predict(lda.model, newdata=test)$class
confusionMatrix(pred, test$DelayClass)$table
confusionMatrix(pred, test$DelayClass)$overall[1]
```
